2. Commit with a descriptive message: `git commit -m "feat: [description]"`
3. Push to main: `git push origin main`

If there are merge conflicts:
1. Pull latest: `git pull origin main --rebase`
2. Resolve any conflicts
3. Continue rebase: `git rebase --continue`
4. Push: `git push origin main`

IMPORTANT: Always push your changes before the session ends. The sandbox is ephemeral - unpushed changes will be lost!
